## Local Installation and Running

### Front-end

#### Installation

1. Download and install Node.js (a JavaScript runtime environment) from their [website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).
2. Start a new terminal instance from the project root directory, run `cd frontend` to navigate to frontend's folder.
3. Automatically install the dependencies needed by running `npm install`.

#### Running

1. Start a new terminal instance from the project root directory, run `cd frontend` to navigate to frontend's folder.
2. Run `npm start`, the front-end server will be created at http://localhost:3000.

_\*For more details, please refer to the [front-end README](/frontend/README.md)._

### Flask Server (Back-end)

#### Installation

Python environment configuration:

1.  Download and install Conda (a Python package/environment management system) from their [website](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success).
2.  Create a conda virtual environment and install the dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    conda create --name arty_backend --file requirements.txt
    ```

Environment variable setup:

1. Navigate to `/backend` folder, create a file named `.env`.
2. Open the `.env` file with a text editor, insert:

    ```
    DB_LINK = <private link to our database>
    ```

    _\*Contact one of our team members to get a private link for testing._

#### Running

1. Make an SSH tunnel to UQ-Zone by entering the command:

    ```bash
    ssh -L 3306:localhost:3306 -J <your_uq_account>@remote.labs.eait.uq.edu.au <your_uq_account>@arty.zones.eait.uq.edu.au
    ```

    Make sure to keep this termianl open.

    _\*If this does not work you may have to set your ssh key to the EAIT Remote Desktop first!_

2. Create a new terminal at the root directory, activate the conda virtual environment by running `conda activate arty_backend`.
3. From the same terminal, run:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    python app.py
    ```
    and keep this terminal open.
4. Now you are set up to run tests for the codebase. Feel free to tweek around the codes here and there.

_\*For more details, please refer to the [back-end README](/backend/README.md)._

### Stable Diffusion Backbone (Back-end)

#### Installation

Download models here:

-   [Stable Diffusion 1.5 (v1-5-pruned.ckpt)](https://huggingface.co/stable-diffusion-v1-5/stable-diffusion-v1-5)
-   [SD1.5 ControlNet models](https://huggingface.co/lllyasviel/ControlNet-v1-1/tree/main)

Installing stable-diffusion-webui:

> **Note**: The `controlnet` folder contains a copy of stable-diffusion-webui with the ControlNet extension pre-installed. If you encounter any issues during installation following the steps below, please refer to the original installation guide for [stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) and [sd-webui-controlnet](https://github.com/Mikubill/sd-webui-controlnet).

1. Run `webui.bat` under `/backend/controlnet` folder.

    _\*The first initialisation will fail as it doesn't have access to the model weights._

2. Copy `v1-5-pruned.ckpt` to `/backend/controlnet/models/Stable-diffusion`, copy the ControlNet model weights to `/backend/controlnet/models/ControlNet`.
3. Run `webui.bat` again, and the stable diffusion backbone server will start.

#### Running

Run `webui.bat` under `/backend/controlnet` folder to start the stable diffusion backbone server.

_\*For more details, please refer to the [controlnet README](/backend/controlnet/README.md)._
