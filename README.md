# Arty - Digital Art Assisstant by Team The Ryuto 6

Arty is a productivity tool specifically tailored for digital 2D art illustrators.
It's a platform that allows artists to automate frequent, repetitive, and time-consuming tasks like reference searching, idea organisation and visualisation, while ensuring the creative process remains entirely in artist’s control.

## Local Installation and Running

### Front-end

#### Installation

1. Download and install Node.js (a JavaScript runtime environment) from their [website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).
2. Start a new terminal instance from the project root directory, run `cd frontend` to navigate to frontend's folder.
3. Automatically install the dependencies needed by running `npm install`.

#### Running

1. Start a new terminal instance from the project root directory, run `cd frontend` to navigate to frontend's folder.
2. Run `npm start`, the front-end server will be created at http://localhost:3000.

_\*For more details, please refer to the [front-end README](/frontend/README.md)._

### Flask Server (Back-end)

#### Installation

Python environment configuration:

> **Note**: The list of dependencies used can be found in [`backend/requirements.txt`](/backend/requirements.txt).


1.  Download and install Conda (a Python package/environment management system) from their [website](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success).
2.  Create a conda virtual environment and install the dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    conda create --name arty_backend python=3.12
    ```
    
3. Activate the conda virtual environment by running `conda activate arty_backend`.
4. Install Pytorch from their [website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
5. Install dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
   ```

Environment variable setup:

1. Navigate to `/backend` folder, create a file named `.env`.
2. Open the `.env` file with a text editor, insert:

    ```
    DB_LINK = <private link to our database>
    ```

#### Running

1. Make an SSH tunnel to UQ-Zone by entering the command:

    ```bash
    ssh -L 3306:localhost:3306 -J <your_uq_account>@remote.labs.eait.uq.edu.au <your_uq_account>@arty.zones.eait.uq.edu.au
    ```

    Make sure to keep this terminal open. This connects to the mysql database run on UQ-Zone as it can be ea pain to set up locally. If you need to test the database and don't have access, please contact Jason as he has been granted access and should be able to add other users.

    _\*If this does not work you may have to set your ssh key to the EAIT Remote Desktop first!_

2. Create a new terminal at the root directory, activate the conda virtual environment by running `conda activate arty_backend`.
3. From the same terminal, run:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    python app.py
    ```
    and keep this terminal open.
4. Now you are set up to run tests for the codebase. Feel free to tweek around the codes here and there.

_\*For more details, please refer to the [back-end README](/backend/README.md)._

### Stable Diffusion Backbone (Back-end)

#### Installation

Download models here:

-   [Stable Diffusion 1.5 (v1-5-pruned.ckpt)](https://huggingface.co/stable-diffusion-v1-5/stable-diffusion-v1-5)
-   [SD1.5 ControlNet models (all of them)](https://huggingface.co/lllyasviel/ControlNet-v1-1/tree/main)

Installing stable-diffusion-webui:

> **Note**: The `controlnet` folder contains a copy of stable-diffusion-webui with the ControlNet extension pre-installed. If you encounter any issues during installation following the steps below, please refer to the original installation guide for [stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) and [sd-webui-controlnet](https://github.com/Mikubill/sd-webui-controlnet).

1. Run `webui.bat` under `/backend/controlnet` folder.

    _\*The first initialisation will fail as it doesn't have access to the model weights._

2. Copy `v1-5-pruned.ckpt` to `/backend/controlnet/models/Stable-diffusion`, copy the ControlNet model weights to `/backend/controlnet/models/ControlNet`.
3. Run `webui.bat` again, and the stable diffusion backbone server will start.

#### Running

Run `webui.bat` under `/backend/controlnet` folder to start the stable diffusion backbone server.

_\*For more details, please refer to the [controlnet README](/backend/controlnet/README.md)._
